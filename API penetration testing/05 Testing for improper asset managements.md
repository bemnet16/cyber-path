# Improper asset managements
It refers to the inefficient or ineffective handling of assets within an organization or by an individual. This can include underutilization of assets, poor maintenance practices, inadequate tracking and monitoring, lack of strategic planning, over-investment or under-investment in assets, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements.

Testing for Improper Assets Management is all about discovering unsupported and non-production versions of an API. Often times an API provider will update services and the newer version of the API will be available over a new path.

Non-production versions of an API include any version of the API that was not meant for end-user consumption. Non-production versions could include:
- api.test.target.com
- api.uat.target.com
- beta.api.com
- /api/private
- /api/partner
- /api/test

### Finding Improper Assets Management Vulnerabilities
Identifying vulnerabilities in asset management practices involves examining various aspects of how assets are handled within an organization. Common areas where vulnerabilities may exist include inadequate asset tracking, weak access controls, lax patch management, insufficient physical security measures, shortcomings in vendor management, gaps in data protection measures, and lack of employee training and awareness.

Testing for improper asset management involves assessing the effectiveness and security of asset handling practices within an organization.



### Mitigation mechanisms

Mitigating improper asset management involves implementing various strategies and controls to address vulnerabilities and enhance the effectiveness and security of asset handling practices. Here are some mitigation methods:

1. **Establish Asset Management Policies**: Develop comprehensive asset management policies and procedures that define roles, responsibilities, and guidelines for asset handling, tracking, and protection.
    
2. **Implement Asset Tracking Systems**: Deploy robust asset tracking systems and inventory management tools to accurately record and monitor the status, location, and ownership of assets throughout their lifecycle.
    
3. **Enhance Access Controls**: Implement strong access controls, including authentication mechanisms, authorization levels, and role-based permissions, to ensure that only authorized personnel can access and modify assets.
    
4. **Regular Audits and Reviews**: Conduct regular audits and reviews of asset management processes, systems, and controls to identify vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.
    
5. **Patch Management**: Establish a systematic patch management process to ensure that asset management systems and software are regularly updated with the latest security patches to mitigate the risk of exploitation due to known vulnerabilities.
    
6. **Physical Security Measures**: Strengthen physical security measures to protect physical assets from theft, damage, or unauthorized access. This may include installing locks, surveillance systems, access control mechanisms, and security guards.
    
7. **Data Protection Measures**: Implement robust data protection measures, such as encryption, access controls, and data loss prevention tools, to safeguard sensitive asset-related information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration.
    
8. **Vendor Risk Management**: Assess and manage the security risks associated with third-party vendors who have access to assets or provide asset management services. Implement vendor security assessments, contractually enforce security requirements, and monitor vendor compliance with security standards.
    
9. **Employee Training and Awareness**: Provide regular training and awareness programs to educate employees about proper asset management practices, security protocols, and the importance of safeguarding assets from threats and vulnerabilities.
    
10. **Incident Response Planning**: Develop and implement an incident response plan to effectively detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents related to improper asset management. This includes procedures for incident detection, escalation, containment, eradication, and recovery.
