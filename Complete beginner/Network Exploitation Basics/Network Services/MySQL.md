### MySQL
It is a relational database management system (RDBMS) based on Structured Query Language (SQL). Too many acronyms? Let's break it down:

**Database:**
A database is simply a persistent, organised collection of structured data

**RDBMS:**
A software or service used to create and manage databases based on a relational model. The word "relational" just means that the data stored in the dataset is organised as tables. Every table relates in some way to each other's "primary key" or other "key" factors.  

**SQL:**
MYSQL is just a brand name for one of the most popular RDBMS software implementations. As we know, it uses a client-server model. But how do the client and server communicate? They use a language, specifically the Structured Query Language (SQL).

##### How does MySQL work?
1. MySQL creates a database for storing and manipulating data, defining the relationship of each table.
2. Clients make requests by making specific statements in SQL.
3. The server will respond to the client with whatever information has been requested.


#### Enumeration MySQL
- port scanning
check that by manually connecting to the MySQL server. We can do this using the command "_mysql -h [IP] -u [username] -p_"
- enumerate info using metasploit /mysql_sql/ 
	- version
	- databases
