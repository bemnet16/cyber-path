### FTP /File Transfer Protocol/
It is a protocol used to allow remote transfer of files over a network. It uses a client-server model to do this, and- as we'll come on to later- relays commands and data in a very efficient way.

##### How does FTP work?
A typical FTP session operates using two channels:
- a command (sometimes called the control) channel
- a data channel.


**Active vs Passive**
The FTP server may support either Active or Passive connections, or both. 
- In an Active FTP connection, the client opens a port and listens. The server is required to actively connect to it. 
- In a Passive FTP connection, the server opens a port and listens (passively) and the client connects to it.

`FTP's standard port is 21`

#### Enumerating FTP
- Enumeration
- exploiting an anonymous FTP login, to see what files we can access- and if they contain any information that might allow us to pop a shell on the system

#### Exploiting FTP
With data from FTP being sent in plaintext, if a man-in-the-middle attack took place an attacker could reveal anything sent through this protocol (such as passwords).
		**Hydra**
		- Hydra is a very fast online password cracking tool, which can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 Protocols, including Telnet, RDP, SSH, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, several databases and much more.

		hydra -t 4 -l <user> -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV 10.10.10.6 ftp

Let's break it down:
SECTION             FUNCTION  
  
hydra                   Runs the hydra tool  
-t 4                    Number of parallel connections per target  
-l [user]               Points to the user who's account you're trying to compromise  
-P [path to dictionary] Points to the file containing the list of possible passwords  
-vV                     Sets verbose mode to very verbose, shows the login+pass combination for each attempt  
[machine IP]            The IP address of the target machine  
ftp / protocol          Sets the protocol
