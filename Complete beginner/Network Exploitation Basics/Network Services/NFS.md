### NFS /Network File System/
allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network. By using NFS, users and programs can access files on remote systems almost as if they were local files. It does this by *mounting* all, or a portion of a file system on a server. The portion of the file system that is mounted can be accessed by clients with whatever privileges are assigned to each file.

you can transfer files between computers running Windows and other non-Windows operating systems, such as Linux, MacOS or UNIX.

##### How does NFS work?
First, the client will request to mount a directory from a remote host on a local directory just the same way it can mount a physical device. The mount service will then act to connect to the relevant mount daemon using RPC.
Then the server checks if the user has permission to mount whatever directory has been requested. It will then return a *file handle* which uniquely identifies each file and directory that is on the server.

If someone wants to access a file using NFS, an RPC call is placed to NFSD (the NFS daemon) on the server. This call takes parameters such as:

-  The file handle
-  The name of the file to be accessed
-  The user's, user ID
-  The user's group ID

#### Enumerating NFS
- enumeration
- port scanning
- NFS-Common
		It is client package in Linux distributions.
		 It includes programs such as: *lockd*, *statd*, *showmount*, *nfsstat*, *gssd*, *idmapd* and *mount.nfs*
		 `command :  use /usr/sbin/showmount -e [IP]`
		 
- Mounting NFS shares
		`sudo mount -t nfs IP:share /tmp/mount/ -nolock`
		
		Tag        Function
		sudo       Run as root
		mount    Execute the mount command
		-t nfs      Type of device to mount, then specifying that it's NFS
		IP:share  The IP Address of the NFS server, and the name of the share we wish to mount
		-nolock   Specifies not to use NLM locking

#### Exploiting NFS
**What is root_squash?**
By default, on NFS shares- Root Squashing is enabled, and prevents anyone connecting to the NFS share from having root access to the NFS volume. Remote root users are assigned a user “nfsnobody” when connected, which has the least local privileges.

	NFS Access ->
	        Gain Low Privilege Shell ->
	            Upload Bash Executable to the NFS share ->
	                Set SUID Permissions Through NFS Due To Misconfigured Root Squash ->
	                    Login through SSH ->
	                        Execute SUID Bit Bash Executable ->
	                            ROOT ACCESS
