### OSI(*Open systems Interconnection*) Model
The OSI model consists of seven layers:

![Table showing the OSI layers: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical](https://muirlandoracle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/OSI-Table.png)

##### Application Layer
It is top layer of OSI model. It provides communication services directly to end-users and applications.
It is responsible for application-level protocols, ensuring that software applications can communicate over a network.
##### Presentation Layer
The presentation layer translates the data into a standardised format, as well as handling any encryption, compression or other transformations to the data.
##### Session Layer
Its primary role is to establish, maintain, and terminate communication sessions between applications. A session can be thought of as a dialog or ongoing conversation between two devices or applications, and the session layer helps manage this interaction.
##### Transport Layer
Its first purpose is to choose the protocol over which the data is to be transmitted. The two most common protocols in the transport layer are TCP and UDP.
The transport layer takes data from the session layer and breaks it into smaller packets for transmission over the network.
##### Network Layer
The network layer is responsible for locating the destination of your request.
At this stage we're working with what is referred to as _Logical_ *addressing* (i.e. IP addresses) which are still software controlled. Logical addresses are used to provide order to networks, categorising them and allowing us to properly sort them.
##### Data-link Layer
This layer focuses on the _physical_ *addressing* of the transmission. It receives a packet from the network layer (that includes the IP address for the remote computer) and adds in the physical (MAC) address of the receiving endpoint.
It is responsible for creating a reliable link between two directly connected nodes, typically devices on the same local network. The data link layer handles framing, addressing, and error detection, ensuring that data can be transmitted across a physical link with minimal errors.
##### Physical Layer
It's the job of the physical layer to convert the binary data of the transmission into signals and transmit them across the network, as well as receiving incoming signals and converting them back into binary data.

### Encapsulation
It is the process of packaging data in a specific format or protocol at each layer of the OSI model or TCP/IP protocol stack. Each layer adds its own header and, if necessary, trailer to the data, creating a hierarchical structure. This process enables data to be transmitted across a network while maintaining the necessary information for proper routing, error detection, and protocol handling at each layer.

### TCP/IP Model
It is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computer network into four abstraction layers. Each layer provides specific protocols and services, facilitating communication between devices on a network.
In many ways, very similar to the OSI model.

The TCP/IP model consists of four layers:
